#  For some reason, Eclipse wants to alphabetize this list. So, all global keys (e.g. buttons, etc.)

# TRANSLATION NOTE:
#         This file is in UTF-8 format, and can include any UNICODE characters.  
#         This is not the JAVA standard, which usually makes translators use \uXXXX escape sequences.
#         Translators can directly paste in Japanese characters.
