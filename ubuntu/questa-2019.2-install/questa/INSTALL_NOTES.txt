            HOW TO GET AND INSTALL A QUESTASIM 2019.2 RELEASE
            ===================================================
 
 
There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1. However, if you are migrating to 
2019.1 from a release like 10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.1 uses 
FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) 
and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 
11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 
11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the 
vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update 
licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
•       FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
•       MSL v2017_1_patch2
•       MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
•       PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

PLATFORM SUPPORT NOTE:
Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have discontinued. Only Windows 10 
is supported. However, we continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 
release series until their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) 
to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

***

DOWNLOAD/INSTALL NOTE:
When downloading UNIX executables with the ".aol" file extension on a Windows box,
please make sure that the "Save As Type"  is set to "All Files".
This is important in order to preserve the ".aol" extension. Otherwise Windows may
append the ".aol" extension with an additional extension which will cause problems
with your installation.

Never overlay a new Questa Sim release over the top of an old release.
Either remove the old release first or install the new release to a
different location. For win32 installations always use uninstall to
remove an old release. Using uninstall will remove the the old releases'
registry entry. For Unix or Linux installations you can simply delete
the old release.

Never do multiple Windows installs into the same target folder/directory.
Always use a new folder/directory as the target for each Windows install.

A complete release contains the install file, the base install file, the platform 
specific install file(s) for your machine type(s) and the documentation install file.

From a linux shell prompt, set the DISPLAY environment variable, and then 
execute the Installer file (questa_sim-2019.2.aol) to begin the installation process.

Use the MSI interface to install the tool to the locations required.  The MSI 
interface provides documentation by selecting the Help button at the top of the window.

Add the Questa Sim executables directory to your PATH environment variable:

	PATH=<install_path>/<platform>

where <platform> can be linux, or linux_x86_64.


-- For Windows --

Never do multiple Windows installs into the same target folder/directory.
Always use a new folder/directory as the target for each Windows install.
